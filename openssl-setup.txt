#Check if openssl is available, output should look like this: /usr/bin/openssl

#openssl command to run with explanation of each flag
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/salt-demo.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/salt-demo.pem

#req: This subcommand is used for creating a new X.509 cert. The "X.509" is a public key infrastructure standard that SSL and TLS adhere to for its key and certificate management.
#-x509: This further modifies the previous subcommand by telling the utility that we want to make a self-signed certificate.
#-nodes: This is used to skip the passphrase option to secure our certificate.
#-days 365: This option sets the validity for the certificate in days. We are setting it for a year here.
#-newkey rsa:2048: This specifies that we want to generate a new RSA key with 2048 bits long along with the certificate.
#-keyout: This option tells OpenSSL where to place the generated private key file.
#-out: This option tells OpenSSL where to place the generated certificate.
